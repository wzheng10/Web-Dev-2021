  <h1>Tellenburg Castle</h1>
  <h2> History</h2>
  <p>


    The castle was built around 1200 by the <a href="randomlink">Lords of Kien</a>. After the Lords of Kien, the Lords of WÃ¤denswil became the
    owners of the castle. They were followed by the Lords of Turn in 1312 and then later by the city of Bern. The
    original castle was expanded and repaired in the 13th or 14th centuries.

    Under Bernese rule, the castle served as the administrative seat of the surrounding area until the creation of the
    Helvetic Republic in 1798. After 1798 it was used as a poor house. In 1885, the castle was gutted in a fire. It was
    never rebuilt and has slowly fallen into ruin.[1]
  </p>
  <h2> Origin of the name</h2>
  <p>
    Tellenburg Castle was built as an administrative center and toll station. Telle at beginning of the name likely
    comes from the German word for toll, Zoll, while burg simply means fortress.[1]
