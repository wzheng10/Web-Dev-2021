selector {
  property: value;
}
Ex:
h1 {
  color: purple;
}

Inline Styles
-you can write your stels directly inline on each element, but this is NOT A GOOD IDEA most of the time

The <style> element
- you can write your stles inside of a <style> element. WHich is easy, but makes it impossible to share stlyes between documents NOT RECOMMENDED EITHER

External Stylesheet
-Write your styles in a .css file, and then include using a <link> in the head of your html document. RECOMMENDED 
- so that you do not have to copy the style on each html page
-a link element will relate the css style sheet to the html
  i.e. <link rel="stylesheet" href="<css file>"

  Color Systems
  -RGB (0, 0, 0)
  -Hex: still rgb but follows (0-9 A-F)
    ex: #ffff00 red, green, blue

  Px(pixels) are absolute units
