HTML 5
  -the latest evolution of the stand that defines HTML
Semantics
  -allows you to describe more precisely what your content is

Block vs Inline ELement -Divs & Spans
Inline elements fit in alongside other elements
Block level elements take up a whole "block" of space

<div> 
  -the HTML Content Division element to group content together 
  such as a picture and a description text
<span>
  -a generic inline container we can wrap around; 
  it is not a block-level element

Assorted Elements
<hr> 
  -makes a divider between paragraph level element
<br>
  -creates a line break exactly where you want to
<sub>
  -makes characters small below the baseline i.e. chemical formula
<sup>
  -makes chracters small above the baseline i.e. exponents

HTML Entities
  -starts with an ampersand(&) and ends wih a semicolon(;)
  -used to display reserved chracters, that normally would be invalid
  -also used in place of difficult to type characters
  -the browser interprets them and renders the correct chracters instead
  i.e. &<code>;

Semantic Markup
  -markup that relates to the meaning of the content
    adding header, footer, nav to distinguish each section instead of using just div

  <nav> - provides navigation links
