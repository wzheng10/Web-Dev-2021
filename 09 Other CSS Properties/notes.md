Opacity& Alpha Channel
Alpha Channel
rgba (red, green, blue, alpha) or hex adds two more numbers to the end

Opacity is a property we set on an element and changes its transparents and on its descendents
applies to entire element plus background

Position Property- sets how an element is positioned in a document
1. static- the default position
2. relative- keep the position  to the normal flow and offset itself based off of top, right, bottom and left
3. Absolute- element is removed from the normal document flow and no space is created for the element in the page layout
- relative to its closest positions ancestor*
4. Fixed- the position will start where it is placed as your scroll
