JAVASCRIPT Script YAY 

Crucial!
1. Understanding the role of JavaScript
2. JavaScript Numbers
3. Variables & Let
4. Const
5. Booleans
6. Variable Naming 

Primitive types- building blocks of JS
Data Types
-Number
-String
-Boolean
-Null
-Undefined

Running Code in the Console
-Easiest place to start is on Chrome developer tools console to write JS
-Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL)

Numbers
-JS has one number type
-Positive numbers
-Negative numbers
-Whole numbers(integers)
-Decimal numbers

(// creates a comment)

Not A Number(NaN)- a numeric value that represents someothing that is...not a number
Ex.
0/0 = NaN
1 + NaN = Nan
typeof NaN #will return "number"

Variables- like label for values
-We can store a value and give it a name so that we can:
    1. Refer back to it later
    2. Use that value to do ...stuff
    3. Or change it later
let someName = value;
Ex.
let year = 1985
Updating the variables
Ex.
let numLives = 9;
numLives -=1; #= 8 or numLives-- #=8

Const- saves a value like let, but the value does not change
useful for conversions 
Ex.
const feetInMile = 5280;
**var was the old way of declaring variables**

Booleans- are true or false values

**Naming Conventions**
-does not allow for spaces
-cannot begin with a number value
-should not use underscores
-must use camelCase
-no single letter variables
-can use is with a name for logical readability
