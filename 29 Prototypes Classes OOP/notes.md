## Object Prototype ##

prototype are template objects

  objects that contain a bunch of methods and we can create a bunch of objects that share the same method without having their own copy

  it is the place where methods are stored

## OOP ##
factory function
makes an objects
add methods
return objects
making objects based off a pattern/recipes i.e. make color

factory funtions are not commonly used

New Operator!
  Creates a blank, plain JS object
  Links (sets the onstructor of) this object to another object
  Passes the newly reated objet from Step 1 as this context
  Returns this if the funtion doesn't return its own object.
