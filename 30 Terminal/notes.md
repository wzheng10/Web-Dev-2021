Relative vs. Absolute Paths
*Important*
Remebering All The Commands


Terminal
  a text-based interface to your computers
  originally a physical object, but now we use software terminals

Shell
  the program running on the terminal

  Bash- one of the most popular shells

pwd- shows the path to your current file
ls- shows all the current files in your directory

cd- changes directories
  cd <filename> to go into
  cd .. to go back out

## Absolute Paths vs Relative Paths ##
Absolute Paths you can go to no matter where you are (aka root directory)
Relative Paths you have to be within the file directory to call

mkdir - creates a new directory
mkdir <directoryname>
mkdir -v Hamster Mouse Goat Cow creating multiple folders at once

touch - creates a file
touch <filename.js>
touch fur.html food.css sound.js size.rb

man - terminal manual for quick look up
man <terminalcommand>

rm/rmdir - removes a file/directory(only on empty directories)
rm -rf to delete directories (r = recursive, f = force)
rm <filename>
rm food.css fur.html
