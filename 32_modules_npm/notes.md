## Module.Exports##
  must require the file to use the function
  and link module.exports to the function to make it work 
    exports. also works but cannot use exports as a variable then

Besides requring a file, we can also requre directories

## NPM (Node Package Manager) ##
  a library of many packages published by other developers that we can use for free

  a command line tool to easily install and manage those packages in our Node Projects
