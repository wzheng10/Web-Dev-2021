  <p>The <b>chicken </b>(Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a> fowl,
    originally from Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be called a cockerel; a
    male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen. "Chicken" was originally a term only
    for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most common
    term for the subspecies in general, especially in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">American
      English</a>. In older sources common fowl or domestic fowl
    were
    typically used for this.</p>
  <p>
    Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies,
    chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BCE).
    [1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
    (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.

  <h2>Cockfighting</h2>
  <h3><i>Main article: Cockfight</i></h3>
  <h4>Two cocks fighting</h4>
  <p>
    A cockfight is a contest held in a ring called a cockpit between two cocks known as gamecocks. This term, denoting a
    cock kept for game, sport, pastime or entertainment, appears in 1646,[89] after "cock of the game" used by George
    Wilson in the earliest known book on the secular sport, The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting of 1607.
    Gamecocks
    are not typical farm chickens. The cocks are specially bred and trained for increased stamina and strength. The comb
    and wattle are removed from a young gamecock because, if left intact, they would be a disadvantage during a match.
    This process is called dubbing. Sometimes the cocks are given drugs to increase their stamina or thicken their
    blood,
    which increases their chances of winning. Cockfighting is considered a traditional sporting event by some, and an
    example of animal cruelty by others and is therefore outlawed in most countries.[90] Usually wagers are made on the
    outcome of the match, with the survivor or last bird standing declared winner.
    Chickens were originally used for cockfighting, a sport where 2 male chickens or "cocks" fight each other until one
    dies or becomes badly injured. Cocks possess congenital aggression toward all other cocks to contest with females.
    Studies suggest that cockfights have existed even up to the Indus Valley Civilisation as a pastime.[91] Today it is
    commonly associated with religious worship, pastime, and gambling in Asian and some South American countries. While
    not all fights are to the death, most use metal spurs as a "weapon" attached above or below the chicken's own spur
    and
    with this typically results in death in one or both cocks. If chickens are in practice owners place gloves on the
    spurs to prevent injuries. It has been banned it most western countries and debated by animal rights activist for
    its
    brutality.
